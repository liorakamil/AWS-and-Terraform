The SDK or CLI on the instance retrieves the security credentials provided by the role from the instance metadata item iam/security-credentials/[role-name]. The SDK/CLI is granted the permissions for the actions and resources that the role have defined through the security credentials associated with the role. 
These security credentials are temporary and aws rotates them automatically. 
New credentials available at least five minutes before the expiration of the old credentials.
